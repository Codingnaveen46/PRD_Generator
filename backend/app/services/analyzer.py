MASTER_PRD_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert Senior Product Manager and Software Architect.
Analyze the following raw PRD or BRD text and extract a structured standardized Product Requirements Document.

PRD Writing Guidelines to STRICTLY FOLLOW:
1. Use plain text only. Do NOT use emojis. Do NOT use tables (they may cause misinterpretation of content).
2. Structure the document into these exact clear sections:
   - Overview
   - Objectives
   - Functional Requirements
   - Inclusions
   - Exclusions
3. Use bullet points where needed: List conditions, fields, or options clearly. Use them especially in Functional Requirements, Inclusions, and Exclusions.
4. Use paragraphs where appropriate: Explain user flows or background context in short, focused paragraphs, especially in Overview and Functional sections.
5. Be specific and detailed: Mention field names, buttons, expected behavior, and form flow clearly. Avoid assumptions.
6. Describe one flow at a time: Explain each form section or system flow separately to keep logic clean and understandable.
7. What to Avoid: NO emojis, NO tables, NO mixing multiple flows into one block, NO generic statements without details.

You MUST return ONLY a valid JSON object with the following schema and NO markdown formatting (no ```json):
{
  "standardized_prd": "(string) A comprehensive, beautifully formatted Markdown representation of the PRD following the EXACT structure and guidelines above. \n- Use double line breaks between ALL sections and paragraphs.\n- Use '##' for the 5 main mandated section headings.\n- Use '###' for any sub-headings or specific flows within those sections.\n- EVERY single detail or requirement MUST be a new bullet point starting with a '*' on a NEW LINE.\n- NEVER group bullet points into a single paragraph. NEVER use inline bullets (like '•').\n- DO NOT include tables. DO NOT include emojis.",
  "quality_score": "(integer, 0-100) A score representing how complete, clear, and actionable the original document is.",
  "missing_requirements": ["(string) Identify key areas, edge cases, or functional requirements that the original document omitted.", "..."],
  "qa_risk_insights": ["(string) Identify potential technical risks, QA testing challenges, security vulnerabilities.", "..."]
}

Here is the raw text to analyze:
